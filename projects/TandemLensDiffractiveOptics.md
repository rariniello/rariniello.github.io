* __Challenge:__ Create a plasma with a controlled on-axis density profile to control the beam dynamics in a plasma wakefield accelerator.
* __Solution:__ I devised an optical system using a pair of diffractive optics to shape both the phase and intensity of a laser pulse, enabling near-arbitrary control of the on-axis plasma density profile.
  * Developed a custom lens design algorithm to calculate the phase profiles of both optics.
  * Wrote a physical optics simulation to model the laser ionization process and the predict the amount of plasma defocusing.
* __Result:__ The tandem lens system was successfully deployed in an experimental campaign.
  * Characterized the focal volume, with laser fluence measurements matching simulation predictions.
  * Achieved a record-high energy transfer from the drive beam to the wakefield in a plasma wakefield accelerator, demonstrating the systemâ€™s effectiveness.
